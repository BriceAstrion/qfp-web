                    people and the planet.

                <p className="text-textSecondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We firmly believe that being able to access safe and nutritious food should be considered a right,
                    not a privilege. But how do you package a litre of milk, transport it to where it’s needed most, and
                    know that when it’s eventually opened, even months later, it is safe and tasty to drink? That’s the
                    challenge we solve with our customers every day. The ‘how’ is a little technical however...
                </p>

                <p className="text-textSecondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We pioneered aseptic technology, which allows us to package a commercially sterile food product so
                    that it can last longer, be distributed further and stored without the need for refrigeration or
                    preservatives. This innovative technology underpins our ability to get food and drink that is safe
                    to consume to the remotest parts of the world where access to safe food cannot be taken for granted.
                </p>

                <p className="text-textSecondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    And this kind of technology has never been more in-need. By 2030, there will be even more people in
                    the world – all of whom will be relying on a healthy, nourishing and affordable diet to thrive. Our
                    ability to make sure food and drink can reach the people who need it, while protecting its
                    nutritional quality will only become ever more important.
